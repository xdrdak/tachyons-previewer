## Atomic CSS is pretty cool

I love the idea behind Atomic CSS. Highly reusable classes with little specificity, very little magic and performant to boot? Of course! It's no surprise that we're seeing folks gravitating towards the atomic css principles. It actually works pretty well!

Buuuut...

## Atomic CSS learning curve & friction

Big issue with atomic css is learning that crazy syntax. Instead of having a nice short class name, you end up with massive strings. Definetly not cool.

And to top it all off, you're now "limited" to a somewhat strict subset of classes.

## Enter the previewer

To control that learning curve and to get going ASAP, I've built a super simple component explorer with an integrated playground. Component templates are written in markdown, so it's real easy to contribute to the project if you have a cool component you want to share!

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
